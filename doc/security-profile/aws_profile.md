## AWS Guidance for EKS

**[Document]**: [EKS Best Practices Guides](https://aws.github.io/aws-eks-best-practices/)  

**Responses**:  

### Security  

AWS is responsible for managing of the EKS managed Kubernetes control plane. This includes the Kubernetes control plane nodes, the ETCD database, and other infrastructure necessary for AWS to deliver a secure and reliable service.  

When it comes to infrastructure security, AWS will assume additional responsibilities as you move from self-managed workers to managed node groups. AWS will also assume responsibility of keeping the EKS optimized AMI up to date with Kubernetes patch versions and security patches. Customers using Managed Node Groups (MNG) are responsible for triggering the upgrade of their Nodegroups to the latest AMI whether through specific action or automatically (such as  when using Karpenter).  

For additional information about the shared responsibility model, see https://aws.amazon.com/compliance/shared-responsibility-model/

#### Security > Identity and Access Management  

##### Don't use a service account token for authentication  

As quoted in the guidance, "At times, you may need to grant an exception for applications that have to consume the Kubernetes API from outside the cluster, e.g. a CI/CD pipeline application."  

The PSK service accounts are used only in the Foundation pipelines. These credentials only have permissions to assume a role, thereby only short-lived credentials are used for all configuration activity. The underlying static credentials are automatically rotated twice monthly.  

##### Employ least privileged access to AWS Resources  

For service accounts, each foundation pipeline uses a role with the necessary permissions. Apart from the platform engineering product team, no other human user has direct aws permissions. Services that interact with AWS managed services use oidc assumable roles created specifically for the service and namespaces via k8s operators.  

##### Use IAM Roles when multiple users need identical access to the cluster  

Apart from the platform engineering product team, no other human user has direct aws permissions.  

##### Employ least privileged access when creating RoleBindings and ClusterRoleBindings  

AuthN for all user access to the cluster is based on an 0auth2/oidc, device auth flow via the Auth0 idp integration. AuthZ is based on membership in onboarded GitHub teams. The platform teams-api manages the creatiaon of all clusterrolebindings for onboarded teams. Teams can self-manage github team membership.  

##### Make the EKS Cluster Endpoint private  

According to AWS, "By default when you provision an EKS cluster, the API cluster endpoint is set to public, i.e. it can be accessed from the Internet. Despite being accessible from the Internet, the endpoint is still considered secure because it requires all API requests to be authenticated by IAM and then authorized by Kubernetes RBAC." Additionally, external access for users is not provided using aws IAM preventing any opportunity for permission escalation.  

##### Create the cluster with a dedicated IAM role  

A dedicated role, not used for any other purpose, is created for the psk-aws-platform-eks-base pipeline.  

##### Use tools to make changes to the aws-auth ConfigMap  

Change to the aws-auth configmap is only made via the lsk-aws-platform-eks-base pipeline using terraform.  

##### Alternative Approaches to Authentication and Access Management  
As noted above, we use an Auth0, oauth2/oidc integration for all User (including admin ) access to the platform.  

##### IAM Roles for Service Accounts (IRSA)
##### Update the aws-node daemonset to use IRSA
##### Restrict access to the instance profile assigned to the worker node
##### Scope the IAM Role trust policy for IRSA to the service account name
##### Disable auto-mounting of service account tokens
##### Use dedicated service accounts for each application
##### Run the application as a non-root user
##### Grant least privileged access to applications
##### Review and revoke unnecessary anonymous access
#### Security > Pod Security
##### Use multiple Pod Security Admission (PSA) modes for a better user experience
##### Restrict the containers that can run as privileged
##### Do not run processes in containers as root
##### Restrict the use of hostPath or if hostPath is necessary restrict which prefixes can be used and configure the volume as read-only
##### Set requests and limits for each container to avoid resource contention and DoS attacks
##### Do not allow privileged escalation
##### Disable ServiceAccount token mounts
##### Disable service discovery
##### Configure your images with read-only root file system
