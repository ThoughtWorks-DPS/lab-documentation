# 2. General team engineering practices

Date: 2018

## Status

Accepted

## Context

While there will be many specific architectural decisions for specific product capabilities and implementations, we also will adopt general team engineering practices that apply to all software development work.  

## Decision

The publically viewable EMPC NA Labs team engineering practices are maintained in this lab-documentation repo [here](psk_team_engineering_practices.md).

## Consequences

- As part of the defintion of done for any unit of team delivery, review the general engineering practices for adherence.
