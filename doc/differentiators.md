DPS labs makes extensive use of SaaS for development, maintenance, and operations. The acceleration and cost advantage of adopting such capabilities rather than either self-creating or self-managing is at the heart of technology choices made by Disruptors.  

Spend labor on creating and maintaining the capabilities that are your strategic differentiators amongst your competitors. Even if you have the financial resources to easily support internal development or maintenance of non-differentiated capabilities, the opportunity cost of delay negates the perceived value and cannot be recovered later through additional investment. New business building (particularly digital business) is a defining characteristic of companies staying in front of the pack.
