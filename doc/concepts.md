#### 1.1.1 Modern Delivery Infrastructure Platforms (Engineering Platforms)

The majority of the EMPC NA oss lab resources are related to building modern Delivery Infrastructure platforms, consumed by internal customers, providing an independentaly useable, product experience.  

We refer to these resource collectively as Platform Starter Kits.  

> A Delivery Infrastructure Platform is “a foundation of self-service APIs, tools, services, knowledge and support which are arranged as a compelling internal product. Autonomous delivery teams can make use of the platform to deliver product features at a higher pace, with reduced coordination.” - Evan Bottcher  

#### 1.1.1 Product Experience

_Product Experience_ refers to a self-serve, consumer experience quality in consuming platform capabilities. The goal is remove all the lead-time planning and engineering friction normally associated with deploying and managing software.  

#### 1.1.2 Use of SaaS  

Throughout these Platform Starter Kit examples you will see extensive use of SaaS development and operational tooling. While necessary for delivering high quality customer experiences through software, none of the tools and technologies used in the development, release, operations, and maintaince of software are themselves strategic differentiators. 

Organizations routinely underestimate the cost of self-managing COTS and development related services in particular, even going so far as to use poorly-suited but familiar tools like Jenkins. I.e., it is frequently the case that an honest and realistic assessment of actual cost reveals self-managed Jenkins as the most expensive component in a dev tool chain.  

Use of secure and well-architected SaaS development tools is consistently one of the most accelerating and cost-saving strategies available. And not only during the implementation phase, but over the entire life of the platform.    

Even if you have the financial resources to comfortably afford the increased costs of self-managed development and maintenance of non-differentiated capabilities, the opportunity cost alone negates any perceived value and cannot be recovered later through additional investment. Invest in creating and maintaining the capabilities that are your strategic differentiators amongst the competition. New business building is a defining characteristic of digitally successful companies.  

#### 1.1.3 Evolutionary Architecture and agility

Avoid pre-selecting technologies and architectures outside the context of an actual capability delivery. Adopt evolutionary architecture as a foundational practice.  

Commit to architecture decisions only after comparative experimentation and based on outcomes of working implementations (poc) of real deliverables.  

#### 1.1.4 Domains of Change

Rigorously architect dimensions for change, both in the selection of tools and technologies as well as in their implementation, e.g., use small or narrowly focused tools that are excellent at one thing and inter-operate easily with other technologies rather than all-in-one products that attempt to do many different things. Have ease (affordability) of replacement in mind.
