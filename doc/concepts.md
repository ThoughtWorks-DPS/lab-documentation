#### 1.1.1 Modern Delivery Infrastructure Platforms (Engineering Platforms)

The majority of the EMPC NA oss lab resources are related to building modern Delivery Infrastructure platforms, consumed by internal customers, providing an independentaly useable, product experience.  

We refer to these resource collectively as Platform Starter Kits.

> A Delivery Infrastructure Platform is “a foundation of self-service APIs, tools, services, knowledge and support which are arranged as a compelling internal product. Autonomous delivery teams can make use of the platform to deliver product features at a higher pace, with reduced coordination.” - Evan Bottcher

#### 1.1.1 Product Experience

_Product Experience_ refers to a self-serve, consumer experience quality in consuming platform capabilities. The goal is remove all the lead-time planning and engineering friction normally associated with deploying and managing software.  

#### 1.1.2 Use of SaaS  

While necessary for the creation of the software-delivered experiences that are central to how modern enterprise provide goods and services to their customers, none of the tools and technologies used in the development, release, operations, and maintaince of software services are themselves strategic differentiators. 

Even if you have the financial resources to easily support internal development or maintenance of non-differentiated capabilities, the opportunity cost negates the perceived value and cannot be recovered later through additional investment. Invest in creating and maintaining the capabilities that are your strategic differentiators amongst your competitors. New business building is a defining characteristic of digitally successful companies.   

#### 1.1.3 Evolutionary Architecture and agility

Avoid pre-selecting technologies and architectures outside the context of an actual capability delivery. Adopt evolutionary architecture as a foundational practice.  

Commit to architecture decisions only after comparative experimentation and based on outcomes of working implementations (poc) of real development deliverables.  

#### 1.1.4 Domains of Change

Rigorously architect dimensions for change both in the selection of tools and technologies as well as in their implementation, e.g., use small or narrowly focused tools that are excellent at one thing and inter-operate easily with other technologies rather than all-in-one products that attempt to do many different things. Have ease of replacement in mind.
